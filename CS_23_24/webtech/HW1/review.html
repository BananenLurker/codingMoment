        <h3>The Shining: <br />Rereading 47 years later</h3>

          The Shining is the story of Jack Torrance, who is employed as the
          caretaker of the gargantuan Overlook Hotel in Colorado one winter.
          Moving his wife, Wendy, and their son, Danny, into it for the
          season, he hopes to find peace: to finish his writing project, to
          escape his latent alcoholism, and to stich his fractured family unit
          together. But when they're alone, Jack appears to go insane, pushed
          into fantasy – or hallucination. Eventually, he attacks his family,
          attempting to kill them in a twisted mirroring of the awful events
          that, it transpires, occurred in the hotel's past. This is the story
          of both King's 1977 novel and Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation
          three years later, but they're vastly distinctive beasts. For the
          King fan, however, it's hard to think of one without the other. The
          Shining is two stories, both the same, but somehow very different.
          <br /><br />

          I first read the book when I was 13, and loved it. It wasn't scary
          per se; it was tense and atmospheric. Then I watched Kubrick's film
          (long before the rating on the box suggested that I should). It
          burned images into my mind: Danny's endless steadicam cycle down the
          hotel corridors, ending with the twins in the hallway; the woman in
          room 237; the creepy partygoers in animal masks; the horrifying
          reveal of the message "Redrum"; the wash of blood from the elevator;
          Jack Nicholson with the axe at the door calling "Here's Johnny!";
          and the maze, with Jack's sloping walk as he pursues his wife and
          child. It destroyed me: it's the only film which, to this day, I
          have trouble watching alone. The original book is close enough to
          the movie in story that – when I began to reread it – I honestly
          couldn't remember what was from the source material and what wasn't.
          They were so entwined that I was unable to separate the atmosphere
          of one from the other, to not let book-Jack's motivations bleed into
          my watching the movie, to not let the horrifying twins appear as I
          read about the hotel corridors.

          It's fairly common knowledge that King isn't a fan of the film
          adaptation. He has described it as "a domestic tragedy with only
          vaguely supernatural overtones", saying that, "a visceral sceptic
          such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of the
          Overlook Hotel." In the novel, as in so many of King's early
          classics, location is all. The Overlook Hotel itself is alive; huge
          and vacant, with secrets hidden everywhere. Haunted bathrooms, the
          echoing memories of debauched parties, a topiary animal garden that
          seems to come to life, wasps' nests that feature a never-ending
          stream of hostile insects. It has a history of bringing power
          towards it, and of trying to grow by consuming that power. In the
          movie, he's a monster. The hotel isn't alive: Jack might be
          possessed, he might not. Either way, he's a bad man. What happens
          would have happened anyway, even if they hadn't been able to see the
          hotel's ghosts; the memories of those it has left for dead.<br /><br />

          I hold the movie and book in equal measure. I remember moments from
          both, where neither medium is more valid than the other. They're
          both stories about hidden evil emerging when the snow sets in; when
          a family is isolated and broken, and when a man with buried darkness
          finally collapses and becomes what he was always, inevitably, going
          to be. Neither is the correct version: one is the original, and one
          is a cover; a different take on the same powerful, terrifying
          material. Neither stands in the way of the other's brilliance: and,
          if allowed to, each can help the other to … well, shine.
