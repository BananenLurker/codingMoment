        <p class="about-author__text--bio font-size--small">
          Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second
          son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents
          separated when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother,
          David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent
          in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time,
          and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother
          brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents,
          Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and
          Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical
          care of the elderly couple. Other family members provided a small
          house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents
          passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a
          nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.

          Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls
          High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the
          University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the
          school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student
          politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to
          support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his
          stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was
          unconstitutional. He graduated from the University of Maine at Orono
          in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high
          school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation
          found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision,
          flat feet, and punctured eardrums. He and Tabitha Spruce married in
          January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the stacks of the Fogler Library
          at the University of Maine at Orono, where they both worked as
          students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a teacher
          immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an
          industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
          occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
          <br><br>

          Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass
          Floor") to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early
          years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's
          magazines. Many of these were later gathered into the Night Shift
          collection or appeared in other anthologies. <br><br>

          Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder
          of the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
